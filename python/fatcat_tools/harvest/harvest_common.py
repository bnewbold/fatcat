    First version of this works with full days (dates)

    General concept is to have harvesters serialize state when they make
    progress and push to kafka. On startup, harvesters are given a task (extend
    of work), and consume the full history to see what work remains to be done.

    The simplest flow is:
    - harvester is told to collect last N days of updates
    - creates an to_process set
    - for each update, pops date from in_progress (if exits)

    NOTE: this thing is sorta over-engineered... but might grow in the future
    NOTE: should this class manage the state topic as well? Hrm.
